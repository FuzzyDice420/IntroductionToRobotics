3. Task: create a menu in the LCD which you scroll through with the joystick. The menu
structure should be the following:
a. Start Game. It will show 3 things on the same screen:
i. Lives: 3
ii. Level: = startingLevelValue, set up in settings. Default is 0
After 10 seconds, the game is over. Print “congratulations, you
finished the game. Press button to exit”.
Level gets incremented by 1 every 5 seconds. Remember to
update the score.
iii. Score: = Level * 3.
b. HighScore:
i. Initially, we have 0
ii. Update it when the game is done. Highest possible score should be
achieved by starting at a higher level.
iii. Optional: save the value in eeprom (google it).
c. Settings
i. Optional: Enter name. The name should be shown in
ii. Starting level: Set the starting level value

4. Notes:
a. Scrolling through the menu is done with a single axis
b. Entering a category is done by pressing the button or using the OTHER axis
c. You should have “>” when scrolling through the menu. The joystick should move
the arrow indicating/selecting the category in which you want to enter.
When pressing the button, you enter the option with the arrow next to it.
d. Example of menu WITH DIFFERENT SETTINGS. Do not replicate it, it’s just for
informative purposes. You can also see the game (next homework, first project)
and better understand the purpose of the menu:
