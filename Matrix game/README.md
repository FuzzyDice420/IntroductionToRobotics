Tank Matrix Game

Game Specifications:
- score
- progress in difficulty (enemy tank shells travel even quicker)
- multiple levels
- more lives (+1 life given by randomly generated powerups)
- save-able highscore in EEPROM
+ maybe animations

Similar to the given example, but with a couple of twists:

1. At any given moment an enemy tank can appear that shoots. Shooting and destroying it grants bonus points to the player
2. Maybe an end boss which can shoot multiple shells at once, each one moving in a different direction
3. Barely evading an enemy shell by standing next to it also grants bonus points
